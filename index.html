        <p> I recently started taking an interest in web development as a hobby to stay busy along with my college work as well as my internship preparation. I do have a liking for C as well as Python but I am working on getting better, now thanks to Web Dev i can say i know HTML AND CSS (not yet reached the java script part) </p></br>

            <p>"I can beat you in any sport you choose. I don't play for fun; I play to WIN. Because, as the greats say:<br>

                'Being second is being the first one to lose.'<br>
                I thrive on competition, and every game, every challenge, is a battlefield where only the strongest survive. Winning isn't just a goalâ€”it's the only option."
